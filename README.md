# littleBigInt
another little pure haxe BigInt implementation (work in progress)


## what is implemented yet:

- string in/output for binary and hexadecimal notation
- addition and subtraction
- comparing (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- negation


## missing features

- multiplication (Karazuba)
- string in/output for any base
- division with remainder
- modulo
- pow and modPow
- binary operations

- Bytes in/output (to store BigInts)


## todo

- optimization
- performance testing/optimizing for all targets
